                <img src="img/centerblock.jpg" id="img1">
                <p> After a record-breaking 35-day budget impasse, President Donald Trump on Friday signed a bill that would temporarily open the federal government for three weeks.</p>
                <p> Trump signed the measure after the Senate and House each passed it Friday, according to the White House.</p>
                <p>Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are being asked to return to work and “reopen offices in a prompt and orderly manner” following the end of a 35-day government shutdown.The Office of Management and Budget sent a memo late Friday to the heads of shuttered departments and agencies after President Donald Trump signed a bill that temporarily reopens the federal government for three weeks.</p>

                <p>With even some conservatives casting the agreement as a retreat by the president, Trump is tweeting that it “was in no way a concession” on his part.</p>
                <p>The president told reporters Friday afternoon that he believes there is a good chance Democrats will agree to fund his border wall after he reached a short-term deal with congressional leaders to re-open the government. “We’ll work with the Democrats and negotiate and if we can’t do that, then ... obviously we’ll do the emergency because that’s what it is -- it’s a national emergency,” Trump said.</p>
