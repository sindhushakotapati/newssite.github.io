The Dayton news site is a multiple webpages application which mainly focuses on the grid partitioning of a news website.
I developed my own grid using css. Each row can be divided into utmost 12 columns. 
The site is developed using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
The major effort is put into creating the grid view in such a way that each block is properly highlighted based on the importance of the content it carries.
There is a weather forcast block, for which I used a external weather widget.
The central block contains the major news of the day, which on click takes you to a new page that details the news displayed.
The subscription and login block is placed at the right of the site which on click takes you to their respective forms.
The site also has other small blocks which contain other news, and tabs to select your topic of intrest, horoscope, a image of a advertismentbetween the news blocks.
